# Implementing NEAT Algorithm on "Code Escape" Game

**"Code Escape"** is a simple side-scrolling survival game inspired by the popular Google Chrome Dinosaur Game. In this game, players must navigate a character through a series of obstacles, including viruses and cloud errors, to achieve the highest score possible. 

I wanted to use this project to kickstart my exploration into Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence by utilising the **NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)** genetic algorithm (GA). Users can watch how the NEAT algorithm develops an AI that can learns to play the game autonomously and improves its performance over time through the _generation of evolving artificial neural networks_.
